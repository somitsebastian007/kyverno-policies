      As application workloads share cluster resources, it is important to limit resources
      requested and consumed by each Pod. It is recommended to require resource requests and
      limits per Pod, especially for memory and CPU. If a Namespace level request or limit is specified,
      defaults will automatically be applied to each Pod based on the LimitRange configuration.
      This policy validates that all containers have something specified for memory and CPU
      requests and memory limits.

      Define and use labels that identify semantic attributes of your application or Deployment.
      A common set of labels allows tools to work collaboratively, describing objects in a common manner that
      all tools can understand. The recommended labels describe applications in a way that can be
      queried. This policy validates that the label `app.kubernetes.io/name` is specified with some value.
